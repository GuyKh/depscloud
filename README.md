The deps.cloud [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo).
After spending a year developing across many different projects, I wanted to simplify the process for new comers.
Instead of needing clone and fork dozens of repositories, you now only need to fork and clone one.

# deps.cloud

[deps.cloud](https://deps.cloud/) is system that helps track and manage library usage across an organization.
Unlike many alternatives, it was built with portability in mind making easy for anyone to get started.

For more information on how to get involved take a look at our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/depscloud/projects/1).
