# Dependency Extractor

Dependency Extractor is a simple gRPC service that encapsulates the logic for extracting library dependency information.
It does this by parsing well known dependency management files (pom.xml, build.gradle, go.mod, package.json to name a few).
After parsing out the information, it returns a standardized representation making it easy to store and query.
